# NSCLCcascadingmodel

The first model diagnoses disease status, the second differentiates between early and late stages, and the third diagnoses cancer stages I-IV. The model accepts any training path and testing path, so it can be trained and tested on any data. The datasets for early v. late and cancer stages consist only of diseased patients. 

The public datasets GSE31210, GSE33356, and GSE50081 used in this study are available online from the GEO database.
